My assignment has many aspects to it which are quite easy to understand. upon completion i have some folders and files which contain different parts of my assignment.Firstly, i have the "ai-conversations" folder which contains 5 files with the prompts ive made with Chatgpt to analyse and update the codes in the assignment.Secondly,i have the "PROMPTING.md" file which contains all the prompts ive made combined into one file. i have the "before-after-examples"folder which contains files with the information about the udpates in my codes including how and why i made changes to the code. Moreover i also have the "Reflection" file which i breifly explained the whole assignment and the details about what ive accomplished.The "checklist" is a list of everything that i needed to complete and i used it as a way to track my progress.
