AI Tools Used

For this activity i used chatgpt and the Gemini AI engines.
They played a big role in thos assignment as i used them first to find
a framework and come up with a strategy for the programming.
i needed to have a solid idea of what i was going to do before
i started in order to avoid confusion and making any errors.furthemore, i used
these AI tools to scan and ask find improvements to the original code and
found ways to improve it. . After that Chatgpt generated the code
while implimenting the new ideas.



Prompting Techniques
 Firstly, i used constraint based prompting which gave it narrower grounds for response.i did 
this to avoid just receiving generic answers which would be far fetched from the actual 
assignment. i told it what exactly to include and this resulted in me getting answers closer to
what i was supposed to get.furthermore, i also maid sure some of my promts leaded to another connecting 
question. This was to help me get to a deeper understanding of what i was doing and where AI was 
getting the answer from. 

What Worked Well?
i was proud of the fact that Chatgpt would have the sollution for my questions and this made the assignment
abit easier.

What Would You Do Differently?
if i had more time i would probably use more AI engines to come up with better ideas and then combine them into 
one final code.


Final Thoughts
i believe that AI engines are a good support line to have but at the same time it is not something to completely rely on.
this is because it defeats the whole purpose of learning the module if AI is going to do everything. furtheromore,
AI can sometimes get you carried away and lose track of the actual goal. This is because of all the information 
that it gives which might not always be straight forward.
